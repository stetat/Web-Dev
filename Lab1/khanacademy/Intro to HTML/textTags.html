    <h1>
        The boy who never stopped dreaming
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        In the quiet of his mind's own night, <br>
        He saw the stars where others saw the dark. <br>  
        No dream too distant, no hope too                     slight, <br>
        Each day a canvas, each thought a spark <br>
    
        For while his feet walked on common ground, <br>
        His soul kept building castles in the air— <br>
        A world of wonders waiting to be found <br>
        By one who dared to breathe and live and dare.
